I worked on a Customer Segmentation project using Python and machine learning. I used a Kaggle dataset to group customers based on their income and spending score. I started by scaling the data and creating 
visualizations to explore possible groupings. Then, I applied K-Means clustering and found the best number of clusters, before visualizing them in 2D plots. 
I also tested other clustering methods, such as DBSCAN, and compared the results. The tools I used were Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
